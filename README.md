Note: 
Run Script in root user.

Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. bs4 module (If inbuilt is not in your machine)

If you don't have python 3 then open terminal and type:

apt-get install python3

If you don't have module which above describe then open terminal and type:

pip3 install urllib 

How to run the script:

1.First of all navigate to the directory in which the script is

2.Unzip the folder

3.Go into unzip directory of KaliFixer

eg. cd /Downloads/KaliFixer

Description about Script:

When you run script it ask for input:

Choose your Kali Linux version from below index number:-
1. The Kali Rolling
2. Retired Kali sana (2.0)
3. Retired Kali moto (1.0)
Press Enter if you don't know which option you want to select
Enter your choice [1-3] 

Now write an number from 1 to 3 index. Now whenever Script ask for password give password. I strongly recommended to start script by root power by root power i mean root user.
